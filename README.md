# project

This project will be a matchmaking system for potential adopters. They will be able to login, 
with a database containing their data, then view many profiles of pets stored in the
systemâ€™s database to find a pet that matches their preferences. 

It is difficult and time consuming to visit shelters and as a result, millions of pets are
not adopted and are euthanized every year. The problem lies in the lack of visitations to 
these shelters due to the inconvenience of travelling to these pet shelters, without having
a chance to know these pets. Especially with covid-19 pandemic, it is harder than before to
travel to shelters for adoptions, leading to more pet euthanizations than before.
